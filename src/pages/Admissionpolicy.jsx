                Aksharaa School does not discriminate against students on the
                basis of nationality, ethnicity, race, caste, color, religion,
                cognitive ability, or physical disabilities.

                The admission policy at Aksharaa is inclusive, transparent, and
                fair. During admission, we look for diversity in the classrooms.
                We aim to have students from all ethnic backgrounds,
                nationalities, and demographics to maintain cultural, ethnic,
                and national diversity in the classrooms. A student's and
                parentsâ€™ attitude towards learning, cooperation with the school
                system, family occupation, family background, financial
                background, and gender balance are taken into consideration
                during the time of admission.

                Students seeking admission should contact the school at the
                earliest to ensure high chances of admission. We are an
                inclusive school and maintain a high level of diversity in terms
                of economic, ethnic, and occupational diversity, and a gender

                Priorities are given to children of Nepalese citizens or foreign
                returnees. We also cater to students from foreign nations. We
                accept transfer students only if the student produces all the
                required documents during the process of admission. Students
                should produce a document showing good moral character during
                admission. Students unable to produce the required documents
                will not be entertained.

                Each student seeking admission to the school should sit for a
                written exam and an oral interview. Admission will be based on
                the merit list, students' ECA/CCA involvement, and overall
                performance. The school reserves the right to admission.
