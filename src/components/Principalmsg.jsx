                  the school along with collaboration with various national and
                  international schools and scholars.This is a matter of pride
                  that the system has been such that the capacity building of
                  staff and students is met through all possible ways.
                  <br />
                  Adhering to the vibrant and progressive curriculum, Aksharaa
                  has reliably delivered quality education with the practice of
                  LRPA module (Learning Reinforcement Practice and Application).
                  Apart from the national framework set by the government, the
                  curriculum is embedded with a plethora of best international
                  practices, holding on to the theme of Glocalization. Sanskaar
                  Yukta Sikshya has been the main motto of the school
                  throughout. Since the priority lies in learning and
                  understanding the process over product, our focus is to
                  upgrade the classroom resources and the physical
                  infrastructure of the school to facilitate smooth education
                  practices and witness tremendous impact in terms of education.
                  Our seamless learning techniques not only addresses the
                  academic needs but tends to holistically mould the child in
                  physical, mental, emotional, social and intellectual aspects.
                  Inclusion of Character Education, Yoga and Spiritual sessions
                  to students is another branch that the school has started for
                  tapping the zone of Spiritual Wisdom. The provision of
                  intensive research based platforms inside and beyond
                  classrooms encompasses multifaceted skills in CCA and ECA too.
                  The classrooms of Aksharaa are spacious and IT friendly and
                  students are encouraged to think, express and exhibit their
                  talent and abilities without any hindrance.
                  <br />
                  {/* Aksharaa has been backed up by a huge group of parent bodies
                  whose collaboration and trust has proven to be instrumental in
                  overall growth of the school. The involvement of parents in
                  shaping a child and making them responsible and balanced
                  adults is appreciated and has always been a matter of pleasure
                  to the school fraternity. The two years of pandemic also
                  enabled us to experience a new form of learning by fostering
                  digital skills in students. The challenge of successfully
                  completing the first few months of e-learning unleashed
                  greater abilities of our team. The future has many great
                  things in store for this family. I am optimistic and ready
                  with my enlarged and enriched group of intellectual leaders
                  and teachers for the future, too. */}
                  <br />
                  I finally express my gratitude to the bunch of students,
                  parents and guardians for trusting us and am committed to
                  unleash the immense potential and grandeur of the school
                  system to nurture the future generation.
